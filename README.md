# Writing Project

This is the GitHub repository for my writing project as a Master's student in Statistics at Montana State University.  I am looking for evidence that pitcher's are more likely to throw over the middle of the plate when their ERA would not be affected.  ERA is a commonly used statistic to evaluate pitchers in basebal.  Having a good ERA is, therefore, a powerful incentive for pitchers.  When this incentive is not present, it stands to reason that pitchers might be more careless with their pitches.  You can view the current paper [here](https://kferris10.github.io/Stat-575-writing-project).
  
I gave my writing project presentation in April, 2014.  The repository containing the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/chessa015/575_Presentation).  The slides are located [here](https://chessa015.github.io/575_Presentation).

I am creating the [Kwproj](https://github.com/kferris10/Kwproj) R package to contain the functions I used to clean and analyze the data.  The package is not currently available on CRAN, but it can be installed from GitHub

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("kferris10/Kwproj")
