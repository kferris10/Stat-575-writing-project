# README

This folder contains code used for various aspects of the writing project.

* `2014-data-wrangling/`: contains the code that I used in 2014 to scrape and clean the pitchfx data
* `code-for-figures/`: contains the code that I used to make any and all plots for these data
* `permutation-testing`: code to perform permutation tests (delete this now that I've created the kwproj R package)
* `clean-pitchfx-data`: code I used in 2015 to clean the pitchfx data.  This is mostly updated versions of the `2014-data-wrangling/` code.
